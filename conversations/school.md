|Nisha| Hi Swati, how are you?|
|Swati| Hello Nisha, I am fine, thank you. How about you?
|Nisha| I am doing good too. Have they started classes in your school?
|Swati| Yes, they have. We have half-day classes now.
|Nisha| Ok. When will they start full-day classes?
|Swati| They plan to do it after Dasara.
|Nisha| How do you find being back to school?
|Swati| I like it. Studying online at home is hard. It is good to be with my friends.
|Nisha| What are they teaching now?
|Swati| We are learning "Pair of Linear Equations" in Maths.
|Nisha| How do you find it?
|Swati| I understand most of it. However, the cross-multiplication method is a bit tricky.
|Nisha| Oh! I am sure you will learn well before the exam.
|Swati| I hope so too.
|Nisha| When will your exams be this year?
|Swati| Our first term exams will be in late October or in early November. They want to complete the first half of Maths and Science books by then.
|Nisha| Wow! That is a lot of chapters. 
|Swati| Yep, it is. It is tough, especially after having such a long break.
|Nisha| Let me know if you need any help.
|Swati| Thanks Nisha, I appreciate you offering your help.
