|Nisha| Hi Swati, how are you?|
|Swati| Hello Nisha, I am fine, thank you. How about you?
|Nisha| I am doing good too. Have they started classes in your school?
|Swati| Yes, they have. We have a half-a-day classes now.
|Nisha| Ah! When will they start full-day classes?
|Swati| They are saying, they will do it after Dasara.
|Nisha| How are you finding being back to school?
|Swati| I like it. Studying online at home alone is hard. It is good to be with my friends.
|Nisha| What are they teaching now?
|Swati| They are teaching "Pair of Linear Equations" chapter in Maths.
|Nisha| How are you finding it?
|Swati| For most parts, I can get it. However, cross-multiplication method is bit tricky.
|Nisha| Oh! I am sure you will learn well before the exam.
|Swati| I hope so too.
|Nisha| When are they planning to conduct your exams this year?
|Swati| Our first term exams will be in late Oct or early November. They are saying they will complete the first half of Maths and Science books.
|Nisha| WOW! That is a lot of chapters. 
|Swati| Yep, it is. It is bit hard, especially after having such a long break.
